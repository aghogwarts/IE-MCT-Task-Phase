- Q1. How to search a missing number in an array that contains integers from 1 to 100?

First we either create a hardcoded array or make one with user input.
Then we make a for loop which iterates through the numbers 1-100. Inside the loop we create another for loop to iterate through every number in the defined/procured array to check with the number from the outer for loop and print it if it doesn't match any of the values from the array.
